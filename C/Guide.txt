To set up environment for C, you need following two software tools on your computer: 
i. Text Editor 
ii. C Compiler.

i. Text Editor : Text Editors is where we will write our programs. Few examples of text editors are as follows:
    a. Notepad
    b. Notepad++
    c. Sublime Text Editor
    d. Visual Studio Code
    e. Atom
ii. C Compiler : The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", 
                 into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
                 
                 The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available
                 compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler.
                 
                 GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
